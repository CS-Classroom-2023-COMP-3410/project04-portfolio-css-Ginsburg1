Overall, I found updating my website to be challenging, but effective. Since adding the style guide, I was able to make everything standardized and avoid having different fonts and colors in different parts of the assignment. 

I found implementing the Nav bar to be straight forward. Since I created it from scratch for this assignment, there were no confects within the code. I created it on the title page and was subsequently able to copy and paste it into the other pages.

One of the issues that I ran into was conflicting style and color guides. I had to go back in my code and delegate lines that were conflating within the style guide. For instance, on my About Me page, the text I had at the bottom was the incorrect color, and I realized that there was a confecting style guide.

Another issue that occurred through development this part of the project was the Gallery. It took me a while to learn how to use flex boxes and make them responsive based on the screen size. Once I figured out how to implement them based on the screen size and the size of the image, I was able to complete the Gallery.

For this assignment, I found Chat GPT and Co Pilot to be very useful, however it has its limitations. It was useful to help implement certain features, but conflicted with itself, and I had to go in and delete and change a lot of the code.
